This Jupyter Notebook (`data-serialization-formats.ipynb`) compares the different serialization formats using `Pandas` and `PyArrow`.
The following formats are being covered in this exploration:

- CSV
- JSON
- XML
- Pickle
- Parquet
- HDF
- Feather

This exploration has covered the following metrics in the comparison:

- Saving Time
- Loading Time
- File Size
- Conversion Time between `Pandas` and `PyArrow`

This analysis has been carried out on different dataframes with various sizes.

This exploration can help us to choose the proper library and serialization format according to our needs.
